BUILD:

	make 


RUN

	/path/to/mpirun $MPIRUN_options /path/to/io-bm.exe -n SIZE_IN_GB \
		[-w | -r] [-b BUFFER_SIZE_IN_MB] [-d] -f /path/to/file/names.out \
		[-s]

where
	-w tells io-bm to write.  You need to do this before you do a read
	   test

	-r tells io-bm to read.  Do this after a write test with the same 
	   options

	-d tells io-bm to use direct io. Cached IO is the default.

	-b BUFFER_SIZE_IN_MB tells io-bm to use this integer as the buffer 
	   size for IOs in MB.  

	-n SIZE_IN_GB tells io-bm to use this integer as the total IO size 
	   in GB.  This is evenly divided amongst the processes, which each 
	   of the N processes generating SIZE_IN_GB/N GB of IO.

	-f /path/to/file/names.out tells io-bm to use the string as a 
	   template for the name of the output files, one per process,
	   unless -s is specified.  

	-s tells io-bm to use the same file for all processes, that is do
	   io to a single file name as specified on the -f /path... argument.
	   Each process will do a seek before doing its write or read.
